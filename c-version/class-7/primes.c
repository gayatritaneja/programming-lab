//write a sieve of erastosthenes to write in rust to write the nth composite number
//largest coprime subset sum. user inputs n, write all coprimes with 30 till 30 and then find the largest subset sum
//set of mutually coprime numbers less than max {1, 5, 7, 8, 9} for example and the sum will be 30wha


//when you run something it has many idfferent functions running.
//local variables go to stack
//things thaat persist across different scopes and domains are generally in the heap
//code up a stack and a queue

//{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10}
